Welcome to the Databricks & PySpark SQL Mastery Hub!

Within this hub, you'll discover an extensive array of exercises and projects designed to enhance your proficiency in Databricks, PySpark, and SQLSpark. This is a project for F1 that has become a very special task for me. Mainly, because I worked with different types of data, inserting them into the database and managing a large amount of data that needed to be organized. I used ETL processes as well as critical thinking for this F1 project.
